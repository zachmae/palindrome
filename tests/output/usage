USAGE
        ./palindrome -n nb -p pal [-b base] [-imin i] [-imax i]

DESCRIPTION
        -n n     integer to be transformed (>=0)
        -p pal   palindromic number to be obtained (incompatible with the -n option) (>=0)
                 if defined, all fitting value of n will be output
        -b base  base in which the procedure will be executed (1<b<10) [def:10]
        -imin i  minimum number of iterations, included (>=0) [def: 0]
        -imax i  maximum number of iterations, included (>=0) [def: 100]
